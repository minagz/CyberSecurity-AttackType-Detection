📂 cybersecurity_attacks.csv

The cybersecurity_attacks.csv file contains raw data used for detecting and classifying cybersecurity attacks. It serves as the input source for training and evaluating the Machine Learning model in the CyberSecurity Attack Type Detection project.
📌 File Structure

This file is structured as a CSV table, where each row represents a security event from network logs, firewalls, or intrusion detection systems (IDS/IPS).
📝 Key Columns

    Timestamp: Date and time of the event.
    Source IP Address: IP address of the traffic sender.
    Destination IP Address: Destination IP address.
    Firewall Logs: Firewall log status (e.g., "Allowed", "Blocked").
    Proxy Information: Presence or absence of a proxy.
    Malware Indicators: Signs of potential malware infection.
    Alerts/Warnings: Security alert level generated by cybersecurity systems.
    IDS/IPS Alerts: Intrusion detection alerts from IDS/IPS.
    Log Source: Source of the log data (e.g., "Server", "Firewall").
    Attack Type (if available): Type of detected attack (e.g., "DDoS", "SQL Injection", "Phishing").

📥 Usage

    Model Training: This file can be used to train the attack classification model.
    Testing & Validation: Helps test the model’s accuracy by comparing predictions with actual attack labels.
    Incident Simulation: Enables the simulation of attack scenarios to analyze the system's detection performance.
